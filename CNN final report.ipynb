    "Classifying bulk materials by the structure borne sound they emit is a quite challenging task in the field of audio signal processing. Most applications of acoustic classification focus on signals with a rather regular and harmonic structure, e.g. music or speech ([1](#costa)), ([2](#palaz)). In the case of environmental sound, less regular and more complex patterns have to be analyzed. Currently, there is a strong trend in applying neural network architectures to solve classification problems. Utilizing modern processing power, these networks are able to successfully classify complex inputs, like pictures with several objects and layers. Such promising advances led to the application of neural networks in classifying environmental sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following work proposes the application of two specific convolutional neural networks (CNN) to the problem of classifying bulk materials. It was build on the results of a previous work ([3](#vishwesh)), which already successfully applied standard depp neural networks (DNN) to this problem. Besides changing the underlying network, the following work will apply different methods for feature extraction and data augmentation in order to improve the classification results. Furthermore, a real time application is proposed, which utilizes the pre-trained network to classify incoming sound information, which is simultaneously recorded by a set of microphones. This way, the CNN setup can be shown to be applicable to real physical environemnts, instead of just relying on precorded signal data.    "

    "Sound, which travels through and/or between solid materials (like metal, wood, plastic etc.) can be defined as structure borne. Having different attenuation factors, the materials chosen can have an significant impact on the classification results. By absorbing acoustic energy, the materials determine how much is left for the classifier. This could e.g. result in a significant reduction of bandwidth by attenuating high-frequency components, leading to a worse network performance, if important features are located in the absorbed spectral region. \n",

The size affects their acoustic bevaviour, too. Having nuts with significantly different scales would result in quite different acoustical patterns, thus benefiting the classification algorithm. In the opposite case, a small difference would complicate the classification, possibly requiring a fine-tuned feature extraction or a large datasets. \n",

    "CNNs are a specific type of neural network and closely related to conventional deep neural networks (which were already discussed in great detail in the prevoius work). Their were originally used for the problem of image classification. Similar to DNNs, CNNs also contain input and output layer as well as one or several hidden layers. While DNNs usually process one-dimensional features, CNNs can be applied to two-dimensional inputs (hence their application to images). The following scheme illustrates the basic structure of these networks ([5](#karol)):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![general_structure](schemes/cnn_general.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After presenting a two-dimensional input, a convolutional layer processes the sample by applying a set of filter kernels, which perform local scans on the sample. Depending on the filter size, more general or more specific patterns can be extracted. The number of filters applied affects the ability of the network to detect more nuanced structures. During backpropagation, the specific values of the filters are adjusted to incorporate the learned outcomes.\n",
    "After convolution, the sample size is reduced in the first two dimensions (due to the filter kernels) and extended in the third dimension, proportional to the number of filters. As a next step, a different type of layer might be applied, the pooling layer. Its purpose is to reduce dimensionality by summarizing parts of the filter values, e.g. by choosing the highest value within a subset of the filter (max pooling). This layer is often applied in applications with large input samples (e.g. high resolution images) and fine, detailed structures. Omiting these layers would increase the computational efforts for the subsequent components.\n",
    "Using these two types of layers, one can construct arbitrary combinations of convolution and pooling, specifically for each application. After the dimensions of the samples are sufficiently reduced, several fully connected layer, known from conventional DNNs, are used to perform the final classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to DNNs, the choice of the network parameters (e.g. filter size and number, sequence of layers, pooling operations etc.) is often highly specific to the application. Thus, the parametrisation for this work is derived from previous research papers, which successfully applied CNNs for the classification of environmental sound. "

    "While most of the work in CNNs was done using image applications, there is also an active research in applying this network architecture to the area of audio signal processing. Pizak ([5](#karol)) used log-mel spectrograms and their corresponding deltas to construct two-dimensional feature spaces, which are then processed and classified using four CNN-type and two conventional DNN-type layers. Tokozume et al ([6](#tokozume)) omitted any method for data transformation and worked instead with the original sound recordings. And Virtanen et al ([7](#cakir)) created samples from magnitude responses, calculated by means of the short time Fourier transform (STFT) in order to classify home environments.\n",

    "Second, there are numerous types of two-dimensional feature spaces possible, although many applications use some variant of the spectrogram. And third and quite typical for deep learning: all architectures require large datasets, which are either already given or created using data augmentation.\n",
    "Many applications feature acoustic environments with mixed signals and sources ([8](#salamon)), which usually requires more sophisticated methods for feature extraction and network construction. In the context of this work, we will focus on classifying one signal at a time.

    "Based heavily on the previous work in ([5](#karol)) and ([6](#tokozume)), two models were derived and implemented. \n",

    "The first one, described in ([5](#karol)), uses the *ESC-50* ([9](#esc50)), *ESC-10* (a subset of the *ESC-50*)  and the *UrbanSound8K* ([10](#urbansound)) datasets as sources for audio samples, using data augmentation to create even more variants. From them, they extracted log-scaled mel-spectrograms as the feature set from the sample inputs. \n",
    "The log scaling changes the Fourier-transformed convolution of the signal and the impulse response from a multiplication to an addition and thus simplifies the separation of both. The projection into the Mel-frequency space provides a more compact representation of the spectrogram, reducing the number of frequency bands from e.g. 256 to e.g. 40 ([11](#mfcc)). Log-scaled mel-spectrograms (and the corresponding Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC)) are quite often used in natural language processing ([11](#mfcc)).\n",
    "The feature space was extended by calculating the deltas of the spectrogram, e.g. the change in spectral intensity between two time instances. Combined, a two-dimensional and two-channel (spectrogram and deltas) feature space was created and fed into a network with 6 layers (output layer not included).\n",
    "The network first processes the inputs with a convolutional layer, consisting of 80 Filters of rectangular shape. Afterwards, max pooling is applied. Further filtering is done by a second convolutional layer, using again 80 filters of rectangular shape. After applying a second max pooling layer, the processed and reduced data set is fed into two fully connected layers of a conventional DNN, using ReLUs as activation functions. The classification is then finally generated by applying a softmax output layer. The following graphic illustrates the full network architecture ([5](#karol)).\n",

    "The second one, described in ([6](#tokozume)), also uses the *ESC-50* dataset. But instead of deriving features by subsequent transformations, the authors used the raw waveform data, dividing it into sections of several seconds and randomly selecting them for training. These samples are then fed into the network, consisting of 8 layers (output layer not included).\n",
    "First, the samples are processed by two subsequent convolutional layers with 40 filters each and a max pooling layer after the processing. This is described as \"Raw-feature extraction\". As a next step, a special pooling layer is applied: a time-series of 40-dimensional vectors, where each vector \"can be thought of as representing frequency-like features\" ([6](#tokozume)). It is further assumed, that the components of the vector \"are learned to be arranged according to some type of law\". Afterwards, two addtional convolutional layers are applied, with 50 filters each and again a subsequent max pooling operation. Finally, two fully connected layers are used, with ReLU activation functions and a softmax output layer. The following diagram shows the complete architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "![general_structure](schemes/cnn_fft_structure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the first model, additional efforts were spent to fit all parameters to the context of this work. Additionally, the feature extraction was slightly altered: after some dissatisfying first tests with this model (characterized by a disappointing classification performance), the input sections are now transformed using the magnitude response spectrum of the real-valued discrete Fourier transfrom (DFT), which is similar to the approach in the previous work ([3](#vishwesh)). The transformation keeps all dimensions of the input signal, thus the following steps remain unchanged.  "

    "Both approaches for a CNN architecture were successfully implemented, trained and tested. Both models generated very strong performance metrics, with accurcy values well above 90 %. But the choice of features to extract, as well as the use of data augmentation methods creates noticable differences between them.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The first model uses a combination of mel spectrograms and their respective deltas to generate the feature set. This, when compared with the more \"ligtweight\" approach of a DFT for the second model creates significant computational overhead: First, the learning process takes considerably more time, which is represented in the amount of training steps necessary (visible in the Tensorboard graphs). Second, the actual application to classification problems still requires the extraction of mel spectrograms from unknown input samples, making it less applicable to real-time tasks. It even proved challenging to generate predictions, given the considerable size of the data sets, which was both due to data augmentation and feature space design.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The second model, while being faster during both training and testing period, contains a more complicated network structure with more layers and more implicit assumptions (see the above [section](#models)) than the first model. The learning process is more volatile, too: When comparing the Tensorboard graphs, the second model produces vastly more \"spikes\", which also exhibit significantly higher amplitudes. As a consequence, the second model might be less generalizable and its strong performance in this context might not be easily reproduceable.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "In order to extend the comparison, more test cases are necessary. Different applications in the classification of enviromental sound could be used to further analyze the performance of both models and determine, whether the additional effort in computation time for the first model really provides realiable prediction in a more general way than the second one. In the case of the second model, additional computation ressources or some specific code optimization might prove helpful and could lead to further insights. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "For the implementation of the real time scenario in the next section, the second model was chosen. The main reason was speed of computation, as the different bulk materials only spent a few seconds on the ramp, requiring fast feature extraction and computation. "

After that, a few possible command line parameters (using `parser.add_argument`) are defined, e.g. to list all available audio devices and to choose a specific one to capture sound. The next important step is marked by loading the actual network weights from the pre-trained network into the template, using `model.load`.The training was done with the same parameters described in one of the last [sections](#second). Afterwards, the actual `callback` function is used, executing for block of input with a size of 2048 samples (defined in `sd.InputStream`). If any microphone signals are available and above an empirically determined threshold (0.01 in this case), the active processing is started: First, the input is DFT-transformed and reshaped to fit the requirements of the network. Then, the block is classified, using `model.predict_label`. The results are stored in `sample_results`. \n",

The concrete performance strongly depends on other factors, too, e.g. the position and coupling of the microphones or the general noise level in the test room. In order to fully adapt the network to the real-time application, additional adjustments have to be made.\n",

Another one might be introducing \"natural\" noise, e.g. working machines and chatting people in close neighborhood. Loosen the coupling of the microphones might be an additional option. This way, they will be more susceptible to background noise, making it harder for the network to extract useful patterns.
